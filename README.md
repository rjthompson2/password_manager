Password manager must:

1. generate unique, random passwords
2. securely store passwords & usernames for websites
3. get, add, delete, update implementation
4. browser integration


Possible future ideas:

# data synced from browser to browser
- reduces friction for user, could mean data is more exposed/vulnerable
# is it possible to automatically change passwords after a set time for every website?
- should be okay because password changing on random intervals was created to protect people from forgetting passwords, but this manager should remember for user
# MFA/SSO for root users on login
# root user protections from brute force/guessing attacks
